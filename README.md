# Simple Components
A small, vanilla JS library for easily replicating controls/components.

## How it works:
Simple components loads components from individual html files and replicates them as many times as specified.
EG: A settings page with multiple text + radio button groups. 
Make the label and radion button in a component.html file
Call simple comps to render x number of them with specific data.

### Developing:
  - Commit to ``staging`` and pr to ``prod`` for changes

### Code Style:
  - camelCase for variables eg: ``var correctUse;``
  - PascalCase for function names eg: ``function CorrectUse();``
  - Brackets should be on the same line
  - Spaces, not tabs
